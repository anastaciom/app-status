# Important notes:

- ## _The application has only been tested on Windows OS machines, it may not work on other OSes. :/_

---

- ## _It may happen that **Windows Defender** blocks the installation because the file is **.exe"**, just click on **"Run anyway".** and the installation will be done normally_
